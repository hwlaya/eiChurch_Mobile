                  Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is
                  hatred, let me sow love;Where there is injury, pardon;Where
                  there is doubt, faith;Where there is despair, hope;Where there
                  is darkness, light; Where there is sadness, joy. O Divine
                  Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to
                  console;To be understood as to understand;To be loved as to
                  love. For it is in giving that we receive;It is in pardoning
                  that we are pardoned; And it is in dying that we are born to
                  eternal life.

                  it's done in heaven. Give us the bread we need for today.
                  Forgive us for the ways we have wronged you, just as we also
                  forgive those who have wronged us. And don't lead us into
                  temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.

                  The LORD is my shepherd. I lack nothing. He lets me rest in
                  grassy meadows; he leads me to restful waters; he keeps me
                  alive. He guides me in proper paths for the sake of his good
                  name. Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no
                  danger because you are with me. Your rod and your staff â€” they
                  protect me. You set a table for me right in front of my
                  enemies. You bathe my head in oil; my cup is so full it spills
                  over! Yes, goodness and faithful love will pursue me all the
                  days of my life, and I will live in the LORD's house as long
                  as I live.

                  that flows freely for us today. Thank you for the unexpected,
